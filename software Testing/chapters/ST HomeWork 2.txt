
with examples all test coverage metrics.



the basis path testing with  McCabe method,  for an example.



how much work on cyclomatic complexity to improve programming than testing,  add essential complexity.  use an example of  condensing the an program graph.



Apply from  guidelines and observations, of McCabe, that "it is important to understand that there are purely criteria that measure the quality of testing and not a procedure to identify the test cases".

 use the commission problem and its program  graph to                 define / use testing.



du  path test coverage metrics,  for  data flow testing.



 slice based  testing for Commission program.



  the commission program in terms of interesting slices,  for the  style and technique.
